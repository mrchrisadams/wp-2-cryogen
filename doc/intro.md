# Introduction to Wordpress to Markdown

This package takes a xml file generated by Wordpress, and offers a series of functions to turn it to a series of markdown posts.

Where contenxt is already in HTML, you have the option of converting it to markdown, to make it easier to edit in future.

### Usage


````
(require wordpres-to-markdown :as wp-2-md)

(wp-2-md.convert "wp-export-xml" "path/to/output")
```
